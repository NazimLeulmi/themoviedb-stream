# Introduction
Subscription based business model implementation in React and NodeJs . I used the movie database public  
API to develop a subscription based movie streaming platform mock-up.  The main goal of this project is to  
get familiar with Stripe’s way of handling subscriptions , and to have a reusable codebase that I can  
implement in any subscription based business model.
